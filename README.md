GEE_xtract is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for extracting remotely sensed data at any scale. We conceived GEE_xtract to both solve ecological scaling issue and to retain High Quality data. The GEE_xtract code was adapted for three public satellites, namely MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel 2, and is ready to include more satellites. Further, the code contains also strategies to combine data from different sources, to soften computation limits and produce advanced metrics.
