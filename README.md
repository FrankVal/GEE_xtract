GEE_xtract is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for extracting remotely sensed data from ground-based data, at multiple spatial and temporal scales where magnitude and how data is aggregated is defined by the user. While GEE_xtract was conceived to solve ecological scaling issues, on the other hand, it was concomitantly adapted to retain high-quality data, thus avoiding biases and anomalies during data extraction. The GEE_xtract code was developed for three public satellites, namely MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel 2, but is also ready to include more sources. The code was prepared for multiple secondary needs, for instance to combine data from different sources, to soften computation limits throgh different strategies, and to produce advanced metrics.

The funcionality of the code can be verified directly on [GEE](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/valeriofrank/GEE_xtract), through a dataset of example, which can be downloaded at Dryad ()
