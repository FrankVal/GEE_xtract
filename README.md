GEE_xtract is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for extracting remotely sensed data from ground data, at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Scales during data extraction and how data is aggregated within scales is defined by the user, and while we conceived GEE_xtract to  solve ecological scaling issue, we also adapted the framework to concomitantly retain High Quality data. The GEE_xtract code was adapted for three public satellites, namely MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel 2, and is ready to include more sources. Further, the code contains also strategies to combine data from different sources, to soften computation limits and produce advanced metrics.
