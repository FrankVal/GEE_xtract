GEE_xtract is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for extracting remotely sensed data from ground data, at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Scales size and how data is aggregated during data extraction is defined by the user, and while we conceived GEE_xtract to solve ecological scaling issue, we concomitantly adapted the framework to  retain High Quality data, thus avoiding biases during data extraction. The GEE_xtract code was adapted for three public satellites, namely MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel 2, and is ready to include more sources. Also, the code contains strategies to combine data from different sources, to soften computation limits and produce advanced metrics.
