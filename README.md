GEE_xtract is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for extracting remotely sensed data from ground-based data, at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Scales magnitude and how data is aggregated is defined by the user, and while we conceived GEE_xtract to solve ecological scaling issue, we concomitantly adapted our framework to retain high-quality data, thus avoiding biases and anomalies during data extraction. The GEE_xtract code was adapted for three public satellites, namely MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel 2, but is ready to include more sources. Also, the code is prepared for multiple secondary needs, for instance to combine data from different sources, to soften computation limits throgh different strategies, and produce advanced metrics.
